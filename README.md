# 63310 Robotics Coding Tryouts  

## üìñ Overview  
This repository is a collection of activities, example programs, and tests designed for the **63310 Robotics Team coding tryouts**.  

It serves as a shared resource for applicants and mentors, featuring:  
- Documentation  
- Coding challenges  
- Example solutions  
- Practice tests  

The tryouts evaluate not only programming knowledge, but also **logical thinking**, **problem-solving**, and the ability to adapt across different coding environments.

## File Structure
- Challenge *(This will be hidden at the beginning of tryouts)*
    - C++
    - Python/BlockCode (Challenge will be the same)
- Practice (Use this to prepare for the challenge)
    - C++
    - Python
    - BlockCode
- EXTRA Practice (Use this to experience difficult coding challenges in real-life scenarios)
    - C++
    - Python
    - BlockCode
    - Maps

Pick your desired language and follow the instructions inside the folder. References to the *Maps* folder will be explicitly stated.

## üíª Supported Languages  
The tryouts support **three programming environments** to accommodate different experience levels:  

- **C++** ‚Üí Standard VEX V5 competition programming language, offering full control of sensors, motors, and advanced logic.  
- **Python** ‚Üí Beginner-friendly, great for demonstrating logic, algorithms, and control structures while still accessing VEX robotics functions.  
- **Block Coding** ‚Üí Visual programming environment (VEXcode Blocks) for those with limited experience in text-based coding.

## üìÇ Repository Contents  
This repository will include:  

- **Activities** ‚Üí Programming tasks of varying difficulty (e.g., movement algorithms, sensor-based tasks).  
- **Challenges** ‚Üí Formal tryout exercises to assess coding proficiency and robotics understanding.  
- **Documentation** ‚Üí Helpful resources for working with C++, Python, and Blocks in the VEX V5 ecosystem.  
- **Basic Rules** ‚Üí Any rules that you will need to know to complete the challenge will be provided.

## üéØ Goals of the Tryouts  
- Identify applicants with strong **problem-solving skills**.  
- Evaluate the ability to write **clear, logical, and functional code**.  
- Provide a fair entry point for programmers of **different backgrounds**.  
- Encourage **growth and curiosity** in robotics coding.  

---

## üöÄ Getting Started  
1. Choose your preferred programming language (**C++, Python, or Blocks**).  
2. Review the provided activities and documentation.  
3. Complete the assigned challenges to the best of your ability.
