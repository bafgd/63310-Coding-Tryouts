Robotics Coding Practice Challenge — Levels

Robot Details:
Situation: The build team created a robot for a mini-game called “Cube Grab.” 
In this game, the robot must pick up foam cubes from the floor and either 
place them on a low goal or push them into a scoring zone. 

You are tasked to code the robot with the following components:
- 4 motor drive (Ports Left: 1; Port Right: 10)
- IMU (Port 2)
- Arm Motor (Port 3)
- Legacy Piston (ADI A)

What does each part do? 
In a real team, communication between coders, builders, and drivers is essential. 
The arm motor raises and lowers the claw. The IMU can be used for straight driving 
and turning. The left drive motor is reversed. 

The driver wants the following controls:
- 4 motor drive
- Legacy Piston (Button A)
- Arm Motor Up (Button L2)
- Arm Motor Down (Button L1)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1: Setup & Initialization
- Initialize the following:
  - 4 Drive Motors (remember: left side reversed)
  - Controller
- Verify that all devices are properly assigned to ports.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 2: Basic Driver Control (OpControl)
- Inside the opcontrol function, create the proposed controls for the driver:
  - 4 motor drive
- Driver should now be able to test basic driving and mechanisms.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 3: Finish Initialization
- Arm Motor
- IMU

--------------------------------------------------------------

Level 4
Button A → Toggle claw piston open/close
  - Button L2 → Arm up
  - Button L1 → Arm down

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 5: Simple Autonomous (Scoring One Cube)
- For the autonomous, create a basic routine:
  - Move forward (10, 10)
  - Turn the heading to 90 degrees.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 6: Finish Simple Autonomous
- Lift the arm to 90 degrees.
- Release the cube into the scoring zone.

---------------------------EXTRA-------------------------------

Level 7: Initialization of ADI
- Initialize Legacy Piston (Port ADI A)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 8: Edit Auton
- Extend the piston when auton ends.
