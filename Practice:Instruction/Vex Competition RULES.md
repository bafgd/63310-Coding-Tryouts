BASIC Rules for vex that are **NEEDED** for coding

Match layout  
First 15 seconds - Autonomous  
The rest 1:45 - Driver Control  

- For Push Back, the robot has to touch the parking zones when starting the autonomous period.
- The bot may NEVER cross the middle of the field onto the opponent's half during autonomous **ONLY**
- Autonomus will be cut at 15 seconds SHARP. Please be mindful of this time limit
- Any interference with the opponent's half of the field that does not involve the robot crossing the half-marked line is considered legal.

Rule of thumb *(not mandatory but highly recommended)*
- Stay in your quarter of the field during auton (you will have a teammate doing similar paths on the other quarter of your alliance's half)
- Do not interfere with teammates' auton
- Worry more about consistency. It's better to score 2 points consistently rather than score 4 points a quarter of the time.

Good Luck!
