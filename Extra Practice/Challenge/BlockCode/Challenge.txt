Robotics Coding Challenge — Levels (Block)

Robot Details:
Situation: The build team created a robot for this year's pushback game.
You are tasked to code the robot with the following components:
- 4 motor drive (Ports Left: 1 & 2; Ports Right: 16 & 17)
- Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover (3-Wire Port A)
- IMU (Port 3)
- Intake Motor (Port 4)
- Doinker (3-Wire Port B)

What does each part do?
In a real team, all members must communicate with each other to understand 
and develop the bot in the best way. A coder must discuss with the builder & 
driver to understand what he or she may want in the bot.

The builder made the Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover to shift the 
intake up and down to pick up blocks and score them. The intake motor and 
left driver motors are reversed. The intake motor is designed so that when 
spinning in the opposite direction, the blocks are sent out to score.

The driver wants to have things mapped in a way that’s easy for him.
Here is what he proposed:
- 4 motor drive (Arcade Drive)
- Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover (Button A)
- Intake Motor (Intake) (Button L2)
- Intake Motor (Outtake) (Button L1)
- Doinker (Button B)

AUTONOMOUS MAP IS PROVIDED "Robot Auton Path.pdf"
FOR ALL AUTONS, ASSUME ROBOT WILL START FRONT FACING THE CLOSEST WALL. Intake faces
front of bot.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1: Setup & Initialization
- Initialize the following:
  - 4 Drive Motors (remember: left side reversed)
  - Intake Motor (reversed)
  - Doinker (3-Wire)
  - Intake Piston (3-Wire)
  - IMU
  - Controller
- Verify that all devices are properly assigned to ports.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 2: Basic Driver Control
- Create the proposed controls for the driver:
  - 4 motor drive (Arcade Drive)
  - Button A → Toggle intake piston up/down
  - Button L2 → Intake in (spin intake motor)
  - Button L1 → Intake out (reverse intake motor)
  - Button B → Activate Doinker
- Driver should now be able to test basic driving and mechanisms.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 3: Simple Autonomous (Scoring One Block)
- For the autonomous, create a basic routine:
  - Move forward
  - Score the pre-loaded block into the goal (using intake/outtake)
- Only required on one side of the red alliance (left or right).

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 4: Expanded Driver Features & Multi-step Autonomous
- Driver Control:
  - Add a toggle state for the intake motor (instead of holding L1/L2).
    Example: press once to intake continuously, press again to stop.
  - Add controller feedback when the piston toggles.
- Autonomous:
  - Extend auton to pick up an additional block
  - Score it (total of 2 blocks).

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 5: Full Match Auton + Driver Polish
- Driver Control:
  - Refine controls for efficiency (e.g., add toggle to certain controls that are beneficial).
  - Allow for precision turning using an extra button (e.g., R1 = small clockwise turn).
- Autonomous: (Total score 3 points)
  - Create an advanced path:
    - Score the pre-load
    - Collect another block & score
    - Score again with accurate turning.
- Add comments so another team member 
  could understand and modify your code.
