Robotics Coding Challenge â€” Levels

Robot Details:
Situation: The build team created a robot for this year's pushback game.

You are tasked to code the robot with the following components:
- 4 motor drive (Ports Left: 1 & 2; Ports Right: 16 & 17)
- Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover (ADI Port A)
- IMU (Port 3)
- Intake Motor (Port 4)
- Doinker (ADI Port B)

The builder made the Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover to shift the 
intake up and down to pick up blocks and score them. The intake motor and 
left driver motors are reversed. The intake motor is designed so that when 
spinning it in the opposite direction, the blocks are sent out to score.

The driver wants to have things mapped in a way that's easy for him.
Here is what he proposed:
- 4 motor drive
- Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover (Button A)
- Intake Motor (Forwards) (Button L2)
- Intake Motor (Reverse) (Button L1)
- Doinker (Button B)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1: Setup & Initialization
- Initialize the following:
  - 4 Drive Motors (remember: left side reversed)
  - Controller
- Verify that all devices are properly assigned to ports.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 2: Basic Driver Control (OpControl)
- Inside the opcontrol function, create the proposed controls for the driver:
  - 4 motor drive
- Driver should now be able to test basic driving and mechanisms.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 3: Finish Initialization
- Intake/Outtake Motor
- IMU

--------------------------------------------------------------

Level 4: Finish Button mapping
- Inside the opcontrol function, create the proposed controls for the driver:
  - Intake Motor (Forwards) (Button L2)
  - Intake Motor (Backwards) (Button L1)
- Driver should now be able to test drive and most mechanisms.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 5: Simple Autonomous (Scoring One Cube)
- For the autonomous, create a basic routine:
  - Move to (15, -12)
  - Turn heating to -90 degrees.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 6: Finish Simple Autonomous
- Move to (25, -12)
- Release the block into the scoring zone (spin the intake motor outwards for 3 seconds).

---------------------------EXTRA-------------------------------

Level 7: Finish Initialization & Button Mapping
- Initialize Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover (Button A)
- Initialize Doinker (Button B)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 8: Edit the Auton
- Edit the path so the Doinker activates at the beginning.
- Edit the path so the Legacy Piston-actuated intake/outtake mover activates before scoring.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Congrats, you finished the Challenge!
